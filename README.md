# Popularity-vs-Critical-Appeal
A brief analysis of videogame reviews from Metacritic. I analyzed the correlation between Meta-scores &amp; User-scores.

Popularity vs Critical Appeal.docx is the actual analysis. It's reccomended to read this file.

Video_Games_Metacritic.csv is the dataset used. It was obtained from Kaggle.

Metacritic_ratings.py contains the code used in this project. In addition to being coded in python, it requires several packages to run properly:
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy.
